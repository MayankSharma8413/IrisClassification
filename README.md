# IrisClassification
1. Introduction
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset used in the field of machine learning and data science for classification tasks. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the species label. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica, based on these features.

2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
The initial phase of the project involved loading the dataset and exploring its structure. The dataset contains the following columns:

Id: A unique identifier for each sample.
SepalLengthCm: The length of the sepal measured in centimeters.
SepalWidthCm: The width of the sepal measured in centimeters.
PetalLengthCm: The length of the petal measured in centimeters.
PetalWidthCm: The width of the petal measured in centimeters.
Species: The species of the iris flower (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).
Data preprocessing steps included:

Dropping the 'Id' column as it does not contribute to the classification task.
Encoding the 'Species' column to convert categorical labels into numerical values.
3. Data Visualization
Before building the model, various data visualization techniques were employed to understand the data better. These included:

Pair plots to visualize the pairwise relationships between features.
Box plots to visualize the distribution of sepal lengths across different species.
Correlation heatmap to understand the relationships between different features.
Histograms to visualize the distribution of each feature across different species.
4. Model Development
A logistic regression model with multinomial setting was chosen for this classification task due to its simplicity and effectiveness for binary and multiclass classification problems. The data was split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing. Feature standardization was applied to scale the feature values to a similar range, which often helps in improving the performance of logistic regression models.

5. Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using two methods:

Holdout Validation: The model was first evaluated on a holdout test set, where it achieved a perfect accuracy score of 100%, indicating excellent performance.

Cross-Validation: To validate the robustness of the model, 5-fold cross-validation was performed on the training set, yielding a mean accuracy of approximately 95.83%.

6. Conclusion
The logistic regression model demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in classifying iris species based on the given features. The project successfully achieved its objective, showcasing the effectiveness of logistic regression for classification tasks, especially on well-defined and clean datasets like the Iris dataset.

7. Tools and Libraries Used
Python
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For mathematical computations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing and evaluating the machine learning model.
